# 🥗 Meal Tracker (AI Project)

This project is the beginning of an AI-powered meal tracking system.

Right now, it can:
- Display and resize food images using Python
- Serve as the foundation for future image-based food recognition

## 📁 Files
- `image_test.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for loading and viewing food images
- `Cheeseburger.jpg` / `steak.jpeg`: Sample food images
- `.gitignore`: Keeps the repo clean

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Add automatic resizing logic with aspect ratio control
- Begin training image classifier for meal recognition
- Track calories/macros from image predictions

## 🧠 Purpose
Part of a larger goal to become an AI expert through real-world, portfolio-worthy projects—starting from the fundamentals and growing steadily.
